# Robotics Task Coordination AI (RTCAI)

## Overview
RTCAI is a conceptual autonomous AI agent designed for robotics and AI mining testnet environments. It focuses on decision-making, task coordination, and adaptive planning without requiring physical hardware integration.

## Purpose
The goal of RTCAI is to demonstrate how autonomous AI agents can manage tasks, allocate resources, and coordinate actions in distributed robotics or AI mining systems.

## Key Features
- Autonomous task prioritization logic
- Resource-aware planning
- Robotics and AI mining coordination concept
- Simulation and testnet ready
- No hardware dependency

## Use Case
RTCAI can be used in testnet environments to validate AI mining logic, simulate robotic task distribution, and explore autonomous coordination strategies.

## Status
This project is currently in a conceptual and simulation-ready stage, intended for research and testnet validation.
